# Silent Failure in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers where asynchronous operation errors are silently ignored, leading to unexpected behavior. The server does not properly handle promise rejections, resulting in a lack of error responses to clients.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a Node.js server that performs an asynchronous operation.  If the operation fails, the `Promise.catch` block logs the error to the console, but the server does not send an appropriate error response to the client. This can lead to confusion for users who may not see any error indication.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version of the server.  The solution explicitly sends an error response (e.g., a 500 status code) to the client if the asynchronous operation fails, providing feedback to the user and improving the server's robustness.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Make several requests to the server (e.g., using `curl` or a browser).  You'll notice that some requests will fail silently.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`.  Now failed requests will return appropriate error responses.
